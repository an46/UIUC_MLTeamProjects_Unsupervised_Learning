# Assignment 1: Clustering
Upload your completed assignment as a single PDF to the course Moodle, with your group
members last names and the assignment number in the filename (for example, bosch-downieassignment1.pdf).

Goals

Students will work in groups of two, demonstrating knowledge of data visualization and
unsupervised clustering methods.

Data

The dataset for this assignment is a collection of health-related tweets from 16 different Twitter
accounts. Each account has its own text file containing the tweets, one per line.

Visualization task

Graph the probability of occurrence for the 10 most common words from each Twitter account.
Are these most probable words related to health?
If not, can you propose a way to improve the results?

Clustering task
Combine tweets from all 16 accounts and cluster the tweets with K-means clustering, using K =
16. Graph these clusters in two dimensions. You may choose to use principal components
analysis (PCA) or another method of your choice to choose two dimensions for visualization.

Does each Twitter account form its own cluster?

Why or why not is this the case?

Optional bonus task

Change one of the parameters used in the clustering task. How do your results differ, and why?
